V8 js engine with C# (in-process), => **Espresso-VE**

NodeJS engine with C# (in-process), => **Espresso-ND**



**Espresso** (from [vroomjs](https://github.com/Daniel15/vroomjs) ) is a bridge between the .NET CLR (think C# or F#) and the V8 Javascript
engine that uses P/Invoke and a thin C layer (_libespr_).

Now, **Espresso can run on .net20+ and  .netcore/.netstandard**

so We can run the engine on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**

(tested on Windows 10)
